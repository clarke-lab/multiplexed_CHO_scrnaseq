This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

library(biomaRt)
ensembl <- useEnsembl(biomart = "ensembl", 
                      dataset = "cgpicr_gene_ensembl",
                      version = "102")

magenta <- geneInfo %>%
   filter(Initially.Assigned.Module.Color == "magenta") %>%
   arrange(-kMEmagenta)

attributes = listAttributes(ensembl)

filters = listFilters(ensembl)


magenta_ens_ids <- magenta$GeneSymbol

magenta_biomart <- getBM(attributes = c('ensembl_gene_id_version', 'external_gene_name'),
      filters = 'ensembl_gene_id_version',
      values = magenta_ens_ids, 
      mart = ensembl,)
```

```{r}
Idents(cho.combined.sct) <- "treatment"
VlnPlot(cho.combined.sct, features = c("percent.mt"), pt.size = 0.5)
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
